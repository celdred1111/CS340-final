final project


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.
One writes programs that are maintainable, readable and apaptable by using good form and modular code. This means code that uses standard practices for readability and naming, as well as writing code in small re-usable blocks.

What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The advantages of this is that the code is reusable and generic to a function and could therefore be used for other similar purposes in the future

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
One approaches a problem via process and sectioning portions to be built on top of each other. We did this in a step by step process for this project. It was a similar, almost indentical process to other ones previously used in my studies

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I would use the parts form this that worked well and adapt parts that would not fit as well. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer Scientists use computing to solve real life problems. It matters because humans are inefficient with this kind of work and we can accomplish more as a species this way. This way Grazioso Salvare can do more efficient work and monitor the animals better.
